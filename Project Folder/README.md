## SP2019 STAT154 Machine Learning Project 2

- Introduction

A comprehensive practice on building and critiquing binary classifiers. 

- Reproducibility

To recreate the report, simply download the `Project Folder`, open `Project Folder/report/Report.Rmd`, and Knit. 

There is only minor content change between the final report in PDF format and the Knitted report. Most adjustments are cosmetic.

Most code is written in R. Some models are implemented in Python for speed purpose. We included the Python output in `Report.Rmd` using assignment statements. For raw Python outputs, please see relevant code under `Project Folder/code`.

- Viewing Order

See `Project Folder/Report.pdf` for finalized report. Refer to `Project Folder/report/Report.Rmd` for complete source code.
